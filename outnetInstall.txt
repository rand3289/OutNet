If anything goes wrong, run "sc delete OutNet" and repeat the steps above
If initialization fails, log file can end up in c:\windows\system32\outnet*.log

User can further create *.service files with local service descriptions you want to advertise
User can also create *.badip and *.badkey files for blacklisted IPs and Public Keys respectively.
