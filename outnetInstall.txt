OutNet Windows and Linux common installation instructions
#########################################################
OutNet is a service and therefore it has to be installed to run as a service.

The first step in Linux or Windows installation is creating or editing start.url text file.
It contains an initial url (IP:PORT) for OutNet to connect to. For example 127.0.0.1:12345
This is where OutNet will connect to find peers.  The file can be deleted later.
You should trust the initial source of the information to avoid problems.

Note, when outnet first runs it creates the following files:
    outnet.cfg outnet*.log publicOutNet.key secretOutNet.key and possibly remoteData.save
User can further create *.service files with local service descriptions you want to advertise.
User can also create *.badip and *.badkey files for blacklisted IPs and Public Keys respectively.

To make sure OutNet is running, you can use onlist utility that comes with Outnet:
    onlist 127.0.0.1 PORT#
